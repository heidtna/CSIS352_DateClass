BUILDING THE PROGRAM
    This program was written in C++ and can be built
    on a Linux system using g++ compiler. To build the
    program type 'make' at the command line to create 
    the executable called 'prog4'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
    Type 'prog5' at the command line after building

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
    This program will run through a main.cpp file that
    tests the various members and member function of the
    Date class. Program allows for various arithmetic and
    relational operations using Date objects as well as other
    methods of conversion and Date checking. Main program 
    will ask the user to enter their birthday twice, for 
    purposes of testing exception handling. Program is also 
    written with a DateException Class

PROGRAM INPUT
    Input for this program can either be through the
    keyboard at the terminal or through redirected input.
    Input is assumed to be dates in Middle Endian (mm/dd/yyyy)
    format. Delimiter between can be any non-digit character.
    Program expects only one delimiter between values.

PROGRAM OUTPUT
    Program will output all test results from main. After input
    of birthdate, program will return the birthdate if valid input
    was given, or throw an exception otherwise.

PROGRAM DESIGN
    Program implements a 'Date' class and a 'DateException' class
    of which objects of each can be created. An object of Date can 
    be created with a default constructor taking no parameters, which 
    will then create the object defaulted to the current date. An object
    can also be created by passing in three integer values in order month,
    day, then year. Program will throw an instance of DateException if an 
    attempt to created invalid date is made, or if an attempt to changed an
    existing Date object is made. Program allows for all relational operations,
    as well as the arithmetic operations that make sense for Date with the
    exceptions of (*,/,%,+). Though the addtion of two Date objects is not
    allowed, an integer value can be added to an existing Date object.

    This program also allows the user to decide the output format of 
    Date objects in terms of order of values, delimiter used, whether 
    month output is integer value or string (3 vs "March"), as well
    as the presence or absence of the Day of the Week for that Date (Sunday,
    Monday, Tuesday, etc.) The user is also allowed to decide on which value
    integer arithmetic operations are performed on Date objects (day, month,
    or year)
